@article{Loizidis.2024,
 abstract = {Electricity market liberalization and the absence of cost-efficient energy storage technologies have led to the transformation of state-owned electricity companies into complex electricity market entities, each having a different time horizon. Deregulation has intensified competition, giving rise to increased uncertainty caused by a multitude of interrelated exogenous factors, resulting in unexpected fluctuations in electricity prices. As a consequence, market participants encounter elevated risks and seek effective mitigation strategies. In this paper, the challenges described in the literature are addressed by studying price distribution histograms in the German and Finnish electricity markets. The objective is to identify normal price intervals that can serve as a foundation for an integrated Day-Ahead price forecasting methodology. A novel approach utilizing the Extreme Learning Machine in combination with Bootstrap intervals is proposed and applied to both markets. The findings demonstrate that Bootstrap intervals effectively capture normal prices, whereas extremely high prices typically align with the upper limits of Bootstrap intervals. Conversely, negative prices tend to fall outside the lower boundaries of the intervals. In order to assess the performance of the proposed methodology, a comparative analysis of its forecasting accuracy against the well-established Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity and AutoRegressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average models is conducted. In addition, both the computational efficiency and forecasting accuracy of the Extreme Learning Machine in comparison to the Artificial Neural Network are assessed. The results reveal the superior efficiency of the Extreme Learning Machine. The developed forecasting model could potentially assist market participants in making well-informed decisions and executing optimal bidding strategies in response to various scenarios before the Day-Ahead market closes. Notably, the proposed methodology transcends the limitations of fixed price thresholds and effectively addresses market nuances, including the occurrence of negative prices, thus offering a more comprehensive approach for electricity price forecasting.},

@article{Lokhande.2023,
 abstract = {With increasing proportion of intermittent renewable energy sources in the electric power system, the system operator (SO) is facing a challenge of maintaining the demand-supply balance which is more dynamic and uncertain than before. To manage the balance, the SO procures different services from balancing service providers like balancing mechanism units and distributed energy resources aggregators. In this work, we propose a model for an aggregator of energy storage systems (ESS). The distributed small size ESS can be grouped and utilized by an aggregator for trading of multiple services with different specifications and bidding rules in ancillary service markets. ESS, being flexible and having quick response time, can contribute in both directions for all the services and assist in maintaining the real time demand-supply balance of the system. The trading strategy proposed in this work captures the regulations and the bidding characteristics of all the services individually. This proposed solution is a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem which becomes computationally complex as the size of ESS dataset of the aggregator increases. Hence, we also propose an alternate approximation method which is scalable, comparatively easy to solve and takes less computation time while giving comparable optimal schedules. These proposed methods have also been compared with an intuitive baseline method. We have demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed methods with real world data of France balancing market.},

@article{Lucas.2020,
 abstract = {The importance of price forecasting has gained attention over the last few years, with the growth of aggregators and the general opening of the European electricity markets. Market participants manage a tradeoff between, bidding in a lower price market (day-ahead), but with typically higher volume, or aiming for a lower volume market but with potentially higher returns (balance energy market). Companies try to forecast the extremes of revenues or prices, in order to manage risk and opportunity, assigning their assets in an optimal way. It is thought that in general, electricity markets have quasi-deterministic principles, rather than being based on speculation, hence the desire to forecast the price based on variables that can describe the outcome of the market. Many studies address this problem from a statistical approach or by performing multiple-variable regressions, but they very often focus only on the time series analysis. In 2019, the Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) was made available in the UK for the first time. Taking this opportunity, this study focusses on five LOLP variables (with different time-ahead estimations) and other quasi-deterministic variables, to explain the price behavior of a multi-variable regression model. These include base production, system load, solar and wind generation, seasonality, day-ahead price and imbalance volume contributions. Three machine-learning algorithms were applied to test for performance, Gradient Boosting (GB), Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost. XGBoost presented higher performance and so it was chosen for the implementation of the real time forecast step. The model returns a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 7.89 {\pounds}/MWh, a coefficient of determination (R2 score) of 76.8{\%} and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 124.74. The variables that contribute the most to the model are the Net Imbalance Volume, the LOLP (aggregated), the month and the De-rated margins (aggregated) with 28.6{\%}, 27.5{\%}, 14.0{\%}, and 8.9{\%} of weight on feature importance respectively.},

@article{Olk.2019,
 abstract = {This paper develops strategies for operating Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) on the Secondary Balancing Power (SBP) market in Germany. Various control reserve market scenarios with participating BESS were simulated for the years 2016 and 2017. Within the simulation, the submitted bids of the SBP auction as a well as the BESS operation strategy have been optimized with regard to maximizing the economic revenues. The simulation makes use of an SBP power price prediction based on a SARIMA model and implements a battery model for lithium-ion batteries providing the aging status and an incremental cost breakdown for a specific operation strategy. With current battery and electricity market prices, the simulation reveals that it is not economically beneficial to provide SBP with a standalone battery. This is mainly due to the high requirements for SBP with respect to the power-to-energy ratio and operation strategy. The simulation further implies that a BESS operating in a pool is possibly economically viable as the restrictions for the power-to-energy ratio do not apply. The value of BESS in a pool is subject to the pool's precise configuration which prohibits a general statement regarding financial viability.},

 abstract = {The study provides a study on energy storage technologies for photovoltaic and wind systems in response to the growing demand for low-carbon transportation. Energy storage systems (ESSs) have become an emerging area of renewed interest as a critical factor in renewable energy systems. The technology choice depends essentially on system requirements, cost, and performance characteristics. Common types of ESSs for renewable energy sources include electrochemical energy storage (batteries, fuel cells for hydrogen storage, and flow batteries), mechanical energy storage (including pumped hydroelectric energy storage (PHES), gravity energy storage (GES), compressed air energy storage (CAES), and flywheel energy storage), electrical energy storage (such as supercapacitor energy storage (SES), superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES), and thermal energy storage (TES)), and hybrid or multi-storage systems that combine two or more technologies, such as integrating batteries with pumped hydroelectric storage or using supercapacitors and thermal energy storage. These different categories of ESS enable the storage and release of excess energy from renewable sources to ensure a reliable and stable supply of renewable energy. The optimal storage technology for a specific application in photovoltaic and wind systems will depend on the specific requirements of the system. It is important to carefully evaluate these needs and consider factors, such as power and energy requirements, efficiency, cost, scalability, and durability when selecting an ESS technology.},

 abstract = {Germany's transition to renewable energy sources for a sustainable future has introduced variability and instability in the national power grid, thus necessitating innovative solutions to ensure grid stability and reliable energy supply. The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) in the German balancing market, notably within the frequency containment reserve and automatic frequency restoration reserve sectors, is a potential stabilizing force. However, the complexity of this integration, governed by specific rules in the German energy sector, has not been fully explored. To bridge this gap, a robust schedule that maximizes the economic viability and reliability of EV integration by considering critical elements such as uniform product size, alignment with local market product duration, and customer baseline load is proposed in this study. Mixed-integer linear programming is used for the effective integration of EVs in the German balancing market. This framework emphasizes computational efficiency, providing market participants with precise insights into EV behavior and strategies for energy storage optimization. The effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method are substantiated through case studies. The proposed method consistently achieved maximum profit and a significant reduction in the number of failed cases, which underscores its applicability in real-world scenarios.},

@article{Kraft.2023,
 abstract = {Quantity and price risks determine key uncertainties market participants face in electricity markets with increased volatility, for instance due to high shares of renewables. In the time from day-ahead until real-time, there lies a large variation in best available information, such as between forecasts and realizations of uncertain parameters like renewable feed-in and electricity prices. This uncertainty reflects on both the market outcomes and the quantity of renewable generation, making the determination of sound trading strategies across different market segments a complex task. The scope of the paper is to optimize day-ahead and intraday trading decisions jointly for a portfolio with controllable and intermittent renewable generation under consideration of risk. We include a reserve market, a day-ahead market and an intraday market in stochastic modeling and develop a multi-stage stochastic Mixed Integer Linear Program. We assess the profitability as well as the risk exposure, quantified by the conditional value at risk metric, of trading strategies following different risk preferences. We conclude that a risk-neutral trader mainly relies on the opportunity of higher expected profits in intraday trading, whereas risk can be hedged effectively by trading on the day-ahead. Finally, we show that reserve market participation implies various rationales, including the relation of expected reserve prices among each other, the relation of expected reserve prices to spot market prices, as well as the relation of the spot market prices among each other.},

 abstract = {Price determination is a central research topic of revenue management in marketing. The important aspect in pricing is controlling the stochastic behavior of demand, and the previous studies have tackled price optimization problems with uncertainties. However, many of those studies assumed that uncertainties are independent of decision variables (i.e., prices) and did not consider situations where demand uncertainty depends on price. Although some price optimization studies have dealt with decision-dependent uncertainty, they make application-specific assumptions in order to obtain optimal solutions. To handle a wider range of applications with decision-dependent uncertainty, we propose a general non-convex stochastic optimization formulation. This approach aims to maximize the expectation of a revenue function with respect to a random variable representing demand under a decision-dependent distribution. We derived an unbiased stochastic gradient estimator by using a well-tuned variance reduction parameter and used it for a projected stochastic gradient descent method to find a stationary point of our problem. We conducted synthetic experiments and simulation experiments with real data on a retail service application. The results show that the proposed method outputs solutions with higher total revenues than baselines.},

@misc{GoogleBooks.05022025,
 abstract = {The markets for electricity, gas and temperature have distinctive features, which provide the focus for countless studies. For instance, electricity and gas prices may soar several magnitudes above their normal levels within a short time due to imbalances in supply and demand, yielding what is known as spikes in the spot prices. The markets are also largely influenced by seasons, since power demand for heating and cooling varies over the year. The incompleteness of the markets, due to nonstorability of electricity and temperature as well as limited storage capacity of gas, makes spot-forward hedging impossible. Moreover, futures contracts are typically settled over a time period rather than at a fixed date. All these aspects of the markets create new challenges when analyzing price dynamics of spot, futures and other derivatives.This book provides a concise and rigorous treatment on the stochastic modeling of energy markets. Ornstein?Uhlenbeck processes are described as the basic modeling tool for spot price dynamics, where innovations are driven by time-inhomogeneous jump processes. Temperature futures are studied based on a continuous higher-order autoregressive model for the temperature dynamics. The theory presented here pays special attention to the seasonality of volatility and the Samuelson effect.

 abstract = {Renewable energy solutions are appropriate for on-grid and off-grid applications, acting as a supporter for the utility network or rural locations without the need to develop or extend costly and difficult grid infrastructure. As a result, hybrid renewable energy sources have become a popular option for grid-connected or standalone systems. This paper examines hybrid renewable energy power production systems with a focus on energy sustainability, reliability due to irregularities, techno-economic feasibility, and being environmentally friendly. In attaining a reliable, clean, and cost-effective system, sizing optimal hybrid renewable energy sources (HRES) is a crucial challenge. The presenters went further to outline the best sizing approach that can be used in HRES, taking into consideration the key components, parameters, methods, and data. Moreover, the goal functions, constraints from design, system components, optimization software tools, and meta-heuristic algorithm methodologies were highlighted for the available studies in this timely synopsis of the state of the art. Additionally, current issues resulting from scaling HRES were also identified and discussed. The latest trends and advances in planning problems were thoroughly addressed. Finally, this paper provides suggestions for further research into the appropriate component sizing in HRES.},

@article{Borovkova.2017,
 abstract = {In this paper, we develop a novel approach to electricity price modeling, based on the powerful technique of stochastic time change. This technique allows us to incorporate the characteristic features of electricity prices (such as seasonal volatility, time varying mean reversion and seasonally occurring price spikes) into the model in an elegant and economically justifiable way. The stochastic time change introduces stochastic as well as deterministic (e.g., seasonal) features in the price process' volatility and in the jump component.

We specify the base process as a mean reverting jump diffusion and the time change as an absolutely continuous stochastic process with seasonal component. The activity rate of the stochastic time change can be related to the factors that influence supply and demand. Here we use the temperature as a proxy for the demand and hence, as the driving factor of the stochastic time change, and show that this choice leads to realistic price paths. We derive properties of the resulting price process and develop the model calibration procedure. We calibrate the model to the historical EEX power prices and apply it to generating realistic price paths by Monte Carlo simulations. We show that the simulated price process matches the distributional characteristics of the observed electricity prices in periods of both high and low demand.},

@article{Byrne.2018,
 abstract = {Today, the stability of the electric power grid is maintained through real time balancing of generation and demand. Grid scale energy storage systems are increasingly being deployed to provide grid operators the flexibility needed to maintain this balance. Energy storage also imparts resiliency and robustness to the grid infrastructure. Over the last few years, there has been a significant increase in the deployment of large scale energy storage systems. This growth has been driven by improvements in the cost and performance of energy storage technologies and the need to accommodate distributed generation, as well as incentives and government mandates. Energy management systems (EMSs) and optimization methods are required to effectively and safely utilize energy storage as a flexible grid asset that can provide multiple grid services. The EMS needs to be able to accommodate a variety of use cases and regulatory environments. In this paper, we provide a brief history of grid-scale energy storage, an overview of EMS architectures, and a summary of the leading applications for storage. These serve as a foundation for a discussion of EMS optimization methods and design.},

 abstract = {Make-to-order firms use different strategies, such as dynamic pricing and due date management, to influence their performance. In these strategies, orders are segmented into classes based on their sensitivity to lead time and price. Quoting different prices and lead times to different classes of customer can increase a firm's profit and its capacity utilization. Most research in this area does not consider the effects of production constraints on price and lead time decisions. In this paper, we consider the role of flexibility in dynamically choosing the price, lead time and segmentation of customers in make-to-order environments with limited production capacity and multi-period horizon under a stochastic demand function. To reflect the dynamic variations of a system's conditions, we propose a Multi-stage Stochastic Programming (MSP) method to jointly determine prices, lead time and production. Furthermore, we assume that demand is a linear function of price, lead time and time. Through numerical analyses, we indicate the benefits of dynamic pricing and lead time decisions, based on different customer classes in various environments.},

@article{Elalfy.2024,
 abstract = {Energy storage is one of the hot points of research in electrical power engineering as it is essential in power systems. It can improve power system stability, shorten energy generation environmental influence, enhance system efficiency, and also raise renewable energy source penetrations. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the most popular energy storage systems including electrical energy storage systems, electrochemical energy storage systems, mechanical energy storage systems, thermal energy storage systems, and chemical energy storage systems. More than 350 recognized published papers are handled to achieve this goal, and only 272 selected papers are introduced in this work. A comparison between each form of energy storage systems based on capacity, lifetime, capital cost, strength, weakness, and use in renewable energy systems is presented in a tabular form. Selected studies concerned with each type of energy storage system have been discussed considering challenges, energy storage devices, limitations, contribution, and the objective of each study. The integration between hybrid energy storage systems is also presented taking into account the most popular types. Hybrid energy storage system challenges and solutions introduced by published research are summarized and analyzed. A selection criteria for energy storage systems is presented to support the decision-makers in selecting the most appropriate energy storage device for their application. For enormous scale power and highly energetic storage applications, such as bulk energy, auxiliary, and transmission infrastructure services, pumped hydro storage and compressed air energy storage are currently suitable. Battery, flywheel energy storage, super capacitor, and superconducting magnetic energy storage are technically feasible for use in distribution networks. With an energy density of 620~kWh/m3, Li-ion batteries appear to be highly capable technologies for enhanced energy storage implementation in the built environment. Nonetheless, lead-acid batteries continue to offer the finest balance between price and performance because Li-ion batteries are still somewhat costly. The applications of energy storage systems have been reviewed in the last section of this paper including general applications, energy utility applications, renewable energy utilization, buildings and communities, and transportation. Finally, recent developments in energy storage systems and some associated research avenues have been discussed. Academics and engineers interested in energy storage strategies might refer to this review.},

 abstract = {The most important applications of an Energy Storage System (ESS) in power systems are energy arbitrage along with procurement of Ancillary Services (ASs). In addition to economic benefits, ESS also improves network reliability and stability. In this paper, a bidding strategy model of a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) in a Joint Active and Reactive Power Market (JARPM) in the Day-Ahead-Market (DAM) and the Real-Time-Market (RTM) using a robust framework is presented. In this study, the BESS model is considered a price-taker, with the private owner trying to maximize its profit while facing price uncertainty. In the first stage of the proposed model, JARPM is cleared in a deterministic way without the presence of BESS to determine hourly prices of active and reactive power. In the second stage, by determining the prices uncertainty interval and the robust budget for DAM and RTM, the robust bidding model aims to maximize the BESS owner's profit, using the robust counterpart formation of the objective function and dual theory. The proposed robust formulation based on a Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming Model (MINLP) is implemented in the GAMS software environment on the IEEE-24-RTS test system. The result shows that by the participation of BEES in the market, the average price of active and reactive power is reduced by 2~{\%} {\&} 3~{\%} respectively. In addition, the overall cost of DAM execution is reduced markedly. On the other hand, the proposed framework in three case studies also guarantees a suitable profit level for the private owners of BESS (30--35 {\$}/hour).},

Keeping this in mind, this paper proposes a two-stage stochastic model including day-ahead and real-time local energy markets with the aim of domestic equipment scheduling, which reflects the uncertain mobility pattern of Electric Vehicle (EV) as well as the variability of micro wind turbine generation. The contribution of EV and battery in providing additional flexibility through bi-directional energy trading has been investigated considering deterministic and stochastic EV mobility patterns. Moreover, the smart home is modeled as a price-taker agent in the local market. Hence, different price-based Demand Response (DR) programs can affect its decisions. On this basis, a comprehensive analysis on the participation of a smart home in various price-based DR strategies is carried out with the aim of determining the most effective DR program from smart home owner point of view. The obtained results reveal that the participation of the smart home in Time-of-Use (ToU) pricing scheme not only reduces the operation cost, but also leads to smart home profitability.},
